# Navigating Data from Phyloseq into MicrobiomeStat 🌐🔄

Let's dive in! Your pathway from Phyloseq to MicrobiomeStat is as smooth as silk:

```r
# 📚 Example code
# Don't forget to have the 'microbiome' package installed first!
library(microbiome)

# 📁 Load the dataset
data(peerj32)
peerj32.phy <- peerj32$phyloseq

# 🔄 Convert the Phyloseq object to a MicrobiomeStat data object
data.obj <- mStat_convert_phyloseq_to_data_obj(peerj32.phy)
```

Just like that, your Phyloseq object 🌿 transmutes into a **MicrobiomeStat data object**.

With `mStat_convert_phyloseq_to_data_obj`, you acquire a **MicrobiomeStat data object** 💾 (a list) brimming with:

* **feature.tab**: A matrix of the feature table 🧬 (OTU table). Superfluous rows with a sum of zero are swept away, leaving only the features present in the samples.
* **meta.dat**: A data frame of the sample data. This serves as a comprehensive ledger 📖, housing the metadata for each of your samples.
* **feature.ann**: A matrix of the feature annotation table 📜 (taxonomy table). Only the rows that have made their mark in the feature table are included.
* **tree**: A rooted phylogenetic tree 🌳. If not already rooted, the tree is given firm grounding by midpointing. Tips not present in the OTU table are pruned 🍃.

By **weaving your Phyloseq object into the fabric of MicrobiomeStat format**, you awaken the boundless potential of MicrobiomeStat's analytical capabilities 🔬 and set the stage for your data to perform in the grand theatre of microbiome statistical analysis.

With your data object prepped and primed 🌟, you're ready to embark on the captivating voyage of microbiome data analysis with MicrobiomeStat. Let the adventure begin! 🚀
